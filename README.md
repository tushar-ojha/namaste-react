# Namaste React!!!

# Parcel
 - parceljs.org. Documentation of parcel is quite amazing!
 - All the work which Parcel do for us is what is important in System Design interviews!
 - Dev build.
 - Setup local server.
 - HMR: Hot Module Replacement (reloading page on some change automatically)
    - Uses File Watching Algorithm written in CPP.
 - Caching - Faster Builds. If we delete it's cache, it will take more time for the first time build.
 - Image optimisation.
 - Minification/compression of files.
 - Bundle! It's core job.
 - Consistent Hashing.
 - Code spitting.
 - Differential bundling. To support older browsers.
 - Beautiful error display view (Good error handling).
 - Gives way to host on HTTPS.
 - Tree shaking: removes unused code/function.
 - Separate build for production and development.
 - Parcel is not doing all this on it's own, this is why it has so much dependencies.
 - Hence, it's not like only using React is making our apps faster. There are lots of other things needed together assisting our app to work it faster and faster.
